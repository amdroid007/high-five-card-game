High-five is a card game app where a player draws a card and has to do the appropriate action according to the card rule. Each time a player miss a high five rule, he/she is penalized. The penalty could be a drink, a dare or instead just play for fun! There are currently five rules:

1. The default rule is for cards that don not have special rule. The player should high five the person before him.
2. The second rule is only for one card (default mode: 5) where the player should high five the player after him.
3. The third rule is (default mode: T) says that the player should high five both players around him.
4. The fourth rule (default mode: Q) says that the player should not do anything but also the direction changes.
5. The fifth rule says that the player should high five himself.
